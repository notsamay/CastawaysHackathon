              Castaways is an exciting high school hackathon event in the South, organized by a group of local high schoolers passionate about technology and creativity. In collaboration with Hack Club, the largest high school computer science non-profit, we're set to create a truly unique experience. Hack Club is dedicated to empowering students with resources, mentorship, and a supportive community to help them explore their love for tech.

              The hackathon takes place in the charming city of Charleston, known for its rich history and vibrant culture. With a fun pirate theme, participants will dive into a weekend full of challenges and creativity. Teams will earn "treasure" by completing tasks, which they can use to purchase hardware and other resources to enhance their projects. It's not just a competition; it's an opportunity to collaborate, innovate, and have a great time.

              Whether you're a coding beginner or a seasoned pro, Castaways offers something for everyone. The event is all about fostering a sense of community, encouraging collaboration, and celebrating the spirit of innovation. Participants will get the chance to showcase their skills, work with like-minded peers, and make lasting memories. Join us for a weekend adventure at Castaways, where tech and imagination set sail together. It's more than just a hackathon; it's a celebration of creativity, learning, and fun!
